## PPoPP 2017 Artifact for our paper:
The original title of our paper is "Demystifying GPU Microarchitecture to Tune SGEMM".
Now it is changed to "Understanding the GPU Microarchitecture to Achieve Bare-Metal Performance Tuning".


These codes are corresponding to section 3 (Instruction solver and GPU assembler KeplerAs), section 4 (SGEMM implementation and optimizations), and section 5 (SGEMM performance evaluation).
Follow the instructions in each directory, and validate the functionality and performance results.
